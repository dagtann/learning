## 5E1.

Which of the linear models below are multiple linear regressions?

1. $\mu_i = \alpha + \beta x_i$ [ ]
2. $\mu_i = \beta_x x_i + \beta_z z_i [X]
3. $\mu_i = \alpha + \beta(x_i - z_i)$ [ ]
4. $\mu_i = \alpha + \beta_x x_i + \beta_z z_i$ [X]

## 5E2

Write down a multiple regression to evaluate the claim: _Animal diversity is
linearly related to latitude, but only after controlling for plant diversity._
You just need to write down the model definition.

$\text{Animal Diversity} = \alpha + \beta_1 \text{Latitude} + \beta_2 \text{Plant Diversity} + e$

## 5E3

Write down a multiple regression to evaluate the claim: _Neither amount of
funding nor size of laboratory is by itself a good predictor of time to PhD
degree; but together these variables are both positively associated with time
to degree_. Write down the model definition and indicate which side of zero
each slope parameter should be on.

1. $\text{Time to PhD} = \alpha + \beta_1 \text{Funding}$
2. $\text{Time to PhD} = \alpha + \beta_2 \text{Lab Size}$
3. $\text{Time to PhD} = \alpha + \beta_1 \text{Funding} + \beta_2 \text{Lab Size}$

## 5E4

Suppose you have a single categorical predictor with 4 levels (unique values),
labeled A, B, C and D. Let $A_i$ be an indicator variable that is 1 where case
$i$ is in category A. Also suppose $B_i , C_i , and D_i$ for the other
categories. Now which of the following linear models are inferentially
equivalent ways to include the categorical variable in a regression? Models are
inferentially equivalent when itâ€™s possible to compute one posterior
distribution from the posterior distribution of another model.

1. $\mu_i = \alpha + \beta_A A_i + \beta_B B_i + \beta_C B_i$
2. $\mu_i = \alpha + \beta_A A_i + \beta_B B_i + \beta_C C_i + \beta_D D_i$
3. $\mu_i = \alpha + \beta_B B_i + \beta_C C_i + \beta_D D_i$
4. $\mu_i = \alpha_A A_i + \alpha_B B_i + \alpha_C C_i + \alpha_D D_i$
5. $\mu_i = \alpha_A(1 - B_i - C_i - D_i) + \alpha_B B_i \alpha_C C_i + \alpha_D D_i$

Model 1 is inferentially equivalent to Model 3. Each reflects a mean adjustment
model for $\mu$, but they differ on the chosen baseline. In Model 1 $\alpha = \beta_D$
and in Model 3 $\alpha = \beta_A$. Model 2, in contrast, is not identified because
it includes all indicator variables simultaneously. Their effects are perfectly
collinear. Dropping the intercept $\alpha$ would solve the problem and transform
the Model 2 into Model 4.

Models 4 and 5 are inferentially equivalent because
$(1 - B_i - C_i - D_i) = 1 \iff B_i = C_i = D_i = 0$. This observation $i$ must
therefore be in category A, and thus: $\alpha_A(1 - B_i - C_i - D_i) = \alpha_A A_i$.

## 5M1.

Invent your own example of a spurious correlation. An outcome variable should
be correlated with both predictor variables. But when both predictors are
entered in the same model, the correlation between the outcome and one of the
predictors should mostly vanish (or at least be greatly reduced).

Electoral turnout in democracies declines over time and increases in the
presence pre-electoral coalitions. However, pre-electoral coalitions became
rarer over time as well. Hence, when controlling for time, i.e. detrending the
data, the association between turnout and pre-electoral coalitions turns out
spurious.

## 5M2.

Invent your own example of a masked relationship. An outcome variable should be
correlated with both predictor variables, but in opposite directions. And the
two predictor variables should be correlated with one another.

Parliamentary government systems are directly associated with stable democracy.
At the same time, a history of military intervention into politics is
indirectly associated with stable democracy, e.g., Latin America. Usually,
parliamentary democracies do not have a history of military intervention into
politics.

## 5M3.

It is sometimes observed that the best predictor of fire risk is the presence
of firefighters. States and localities with many firefighters also have more
fires. Presumably firefighters do not cause fires. Nevertheless, this is not a
spurious correlation. Instead fires cause firefighters. Consider the same
reversal of causal inference in the context of the divorce and marriage data.
How might a high divorce rate cause a higher marriage rate? Can you think of a
way to evaluate this relationship, using multiple regression?

Assume some policy grants cheap loans to newly weds, regardless of how often
individuals were already married. Hence, individuals have strong incentive to
get married again should they divorce their partner.

5M4.

In the divorce data, States with high numbers of Mormons (members of The Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, LDS) have much lower divorce rates than
the regression models expected. Find a list of LDS population by State and use
those numbers as a predictor variable, predicting divorce rate using marriage
rate, median age at marriage, and percent LDS population (possibly
standardized). You may want to consider transformations of the raw percent LDS
variable.

```{r}
data(WaffleDivorce)
lds <- read.csv2("~/github/learning/rethinking/lds_pop.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
lds <- mutate(lds, lds_per = str_replace(lds_per, "%", "")) %>%
    mutate(lds_per = str_replace(lds_per, ",", ".")) %>%
    mutate(lds_per = as.numeric(lds_per))
names(WaffleDivorce) <- str_to_lower(names(WaffleDivorce))
WaffleDivorce <- left_join(WaffleDivorce, lds, by = "location")

summary(WaffleDivorce$lds_per)
car::symbox(WaffleDivorce$lds_per)
plot(WaffleDivorce$lds_per, WaffleDivorce$lds_per^(-1))
WaffleDivorce <- mutate(WaffleDivorce, inv_lds_per = lds_per^(-1))

stan_data <- list(
    y = WaffleDivorce$divorce,
    X = cbind(1, mar = WaffleDivorce$marriage,
        age = WaffleDivorce$medianagemarriage, lds = WaffleDivorce$inv_lds_per
    ),
    N = nrow(WaffleDivorce),
    K = 4
)
stan_model <- "
    data {
        int<lower = 0> N;
        int<lower = 1> K;
        matrix[N, K] X;
        vector[N] y;
    }
    parameters {
        vector[K] beta;
        real<lower=0> sigma;
    }
    model {
        y ~ normal(X * beta, sigma);
        beta ~ normal(0, 1);
        sigma ~ exponential(1);
    }

"
stan_fit <- stan(model_code = stan_model, data = stan_data)
post <- rstan::extract(stan_fit)
mean(post$beta[, 4] > 0); plot(density(post$beta[, 4]))
```

Mormon creed has the expected negative effect on divorce rate. However, that
effect is quite uncertain because (a) a sizable part of the posterior extends
beyond 0, and (b) the result is quite sensitive to adjustment of the prior
(not shown). More definite results require stronger priors.

## 5M5.

One way to reason through multiple causation hypotheses is to imagine detailed
mechanisms through which predictor variables may influence outcomes. For
example, it is sometimes argued that the price of gasoline (predictor variable)
is positively associated with lower obesity rates (outcome variable). However,
there are at least two important mechanisms by which the price of gas could
reduce obesity. First, it could lead to less driving and therefore more
exercise. Second, it could lead to less driving, which leads to less eating out,
which leads to less consumption of huge restaurant meals. Can you outline one
or more multiple regressions that address these two mechanisms? Assume you can
have any predictor data you need.

Testing each mechanism requires (partially) blocking the path from fuel price
to obesity.

- Path 1 Fuel Price -> Exercise -> Obesity: Assume you have daily, individual
    level measurements of fuel price per liter last paid, steps taken, and
    weight. In this model, the effect fuel price on weight should by
    substantially diminished by steps taken.
- Path 2 Fuel Price -> Eating Out -> Calorie Intake while eating out -> Weight:
    In this scenario, including any of the intervening variables should attenuate
    the effect of fuel price. Note that "Calorie Intake while eating out" is
    only a more precise measurement of "Eating out". Therefore, you might
    consider including only the former in your analysis (multicollinearity).

```{r, foxes}
data(foxes)
str(foxes)
summary(foxes)
car::scatterplotMatrix(foxes[, -1])

# (a) Bivariate regression on area
stan_data <- list(y = foxes$weight, X = cbind(1, foxes$area), N = nrow(foxes), K = 2)
stan_area <- stan(model_code = stan_model, data = stan_data)
stan_area
post <- rstan::extract(stan_area)

X_pred <- cbind(1, seq(min(foxes$area), max(foxes$area), length.out = 30))
plot(foxes$area, foxes$weight)
postmu_samples <- sample(seq(nrow(post[["beta"]])), 100, replace = TRUE)
postmu_linpred <- X_pred %*% t(post[["beta"]][postmu_samples, ])
for (i in seq(ncol(postmu_linpred))) {
    lines(X_pred[, 2], postmu_linpred[, i], col = "grey75")
}

postmu_beta <- apply(post$beta, 2, mean)
postmu_ci <- apply(post$beta, 2, HPDI, prob = .95)
postmu_linpred <- X_pred %*% postmu_beta
lines(X_pred[, 2], postmu_linpred, col = "red")

# (b) Bivariate regression on groupsize
stan_data <- list(y = foxes$weight, X = cbind(1, foxes$groupsize), N = nrow(foxes), K = 2)
stan_groupsize <- stan(model_code = stan_model, data = stan_data)
stan_groupsize
post <- rstan::extract(stan_groupsize)

X_pred <- cbind(1, seq(min(foxes$groupsize), max(foxes$groupsize), length.out = 30))
plot(foxes$groupsize, foxes$weight)
postmu_samples <- sample(seq(nrow(post[["beta"]])), 100, replace = TRUE)
postmu_linpred <- X_pred %*% t(post[["beta"]][postmu_samples, ])
for (i in seq(ncol(postmu_linpred))) {
    lines(X_pred[, 2], postmu_linpred[, i], col = "grey75")
}

postmu_beta <- apply(post$beta, 2, mean)
postmu_ci <- apply(post$beta, 2, HPDI, prob = .95)
postmu_linpred <- X_pred %*% postmu_beta
lines(X_pred[, 2], postmu_linpred, col = "red")
```

Neither predictor looks important. However, group size and are strongly
positively correlated. If area increases weight and group size decreases it,
then their effects will cancel out unless simultaneously accounted for.

## 5H2.

Now fit a multiple linear regression with weight as the outcome and both area
and groupsize as predictor variables. Plot the predictions of the model for
each predictor, holding the other predictor constant at its mean. What does
this model say about the importance of each variable? Why do you get different
results than you got in the exercise just above?

```{r}
stan_data <- list(y = foxes$weight, X = cbind(1, foxes$area, foxes$groupsize),
    N = nrow(foxes), K = 3
)
stan_5H2 <- stan(model_code = stan_model, data = stan_data)
stan_5H2
```

Now Stan supports a strong positive effect of area and a strong negative effect
of group size. Both predictors strongly influence the outcome, but because they
are also inversely associated each masks the effect of the other.

## 5H3

Finally, consider the avgfood variable. Fit two more multiple regressions:
(1) body weight as an additive function of avgfood and groupsize, and (2) body
weight as an additive function of all three variables, avgfood and groupsize
and area. Compare the results of these models to the previous models youâ€™ve fit,
in the first two exercises. (a) Is avgfood or area a better predictor of body
weight? If you had to choose one or the other to include in a model, which
would it be? Support your assessment with any tables or plots you choose.
(b) When both avgfood or area are in the same model, their effects are reduced
(closer to zero) and their standard errors are larger than when they are
included in separate models. Can you explain this result?

### 5H3.I

```{r}
cor(foxes[, -1])
# Note: Average food is strongly associated with groupsize and area.
#   Multicollinearity may be an issue
```

```{r}
# (1) weight ~ avgfood + groupsize
stan_data <- list(y = foxes$weight,
    X = cbind(1, foxes$avgfood, foxes$groupsize), N = nrow(foxes), K = 3
)
stan_5H3.1 <- stan(model_code = stan_model, data = stan_data)
stan_data <- list(y = foxes$weight,
    X = cbind(1, foxes$avgfood, foxes$area, foxes$groupsize),
    N = nrow(foxes), K = 4
)
stan_5H3.2 <- stan(model_code = stan_model, data = stan_data)
stan_5H2; stan_5H3.1; stan_5H3.2
```
### 5H3.II

Since I didn't scale the variables, I cannot directly compare the effect
estimates. I can, however, compare $R^2 = 1 - RSS / TSS$.

```{r}
TSS <- sum((foxes$weight - mean(foxes$weight)) ^ 2)
# RSS_5H2
post <- rstan::extract(stan_5H2)
postmu_beta <- apply(post[["beta"]], 2, mean)
linpred <- cbind(1, foxes$area, foxes$groupsize) %*% postmu_beta
RSS_5H2 <- sum((foxes$weight - linpred) ^ 2)
1 - RSS_5H2 / TSS
# RSS_5H3.1
post <- rstan::extract(stan_5H3.1)
postmu_beta <- apply(post[["beta"]], 2, mean)
linpred <- cbind(1, foxes$avgfood, foxes$groupsize) %*% postmu_beta
RSS_5H3.1 <- sum((foxes$weight - linpred) ^ 2)
1 - RSS_5H3.1 / TSS
```
In terms of explained variance, avgfood seems to be the better predictor.

### 5H3.III

```{r}
ggplot(data = foxes, aes(x = area, y = avgfood, colour = factor(groupsize))) +
    geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
    geom_smooth(aes(colour = NULL), method = "lm")
lm(avgfood ~ 0 + area, data = as.data.frame(apply(foxes, 2, scale)))
lm(avgfood ~ 0 + area + groupsize, data = as.data.frame(apply(foxes, 2, scale)))
```

Group size is a common correlate of avgfood and area. When controlling
